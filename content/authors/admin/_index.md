I'm a PhD student with the Vision 1 lab at Teagasc, under Prof. Paul Cotter. My thesis (projected submission Autumn 2023) investigates bacterial quorum sensing using a combination of wet and dry lab approaches, with my main research interests being in bacterial genomics and microbial ecology. I am open to upcoming opportunities with like-minded collaborators, as well as connecting with other microbiologists grappling with similiar problems.
